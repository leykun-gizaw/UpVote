## :star2: Description

- This project is a very rudmentary project that I made to use one important power that Vue has; <strong><em>reactivity</em></strong>.
- It finishes everything on a single Javascript file [main.js](/public/main.js).
- It is also live [here](https://leykun-gizaw.github.io/UpVote) which I setup with the help of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (work in progress).
- Project scaffold was constructed using [Vite](vitjs.dev).
